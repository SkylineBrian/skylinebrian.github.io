Dr. Yujie Hu joins the Editorial Board of Computers, Environment and Urban Systems.

<em>Computers, Environment and Urban Systems</em> is an interdisciplinary journal publishing cutting-edge and innovative <strong>computer-based research</strong> on <strong>urban systems, systems of cities, and built and natural environments </strong>, that privileges the <strong>geospatial</strong> perspective. The journal provides a stimulating presentation of perspectives, research developments, overviews of important new technologies and uses of major computational, information-based, and visualization innovations. Applied and theoretical contributions demonstrate the scope of computer-based analysis fostering a better understanding of urban systems, the synergistic relationships between built and natural environments, their spatial scope and their dynamics.

Application areas include infrastructure and facilities management, physical planning and urban design, land use and transportation, business and service planning, coupled human and natural systems, urban planning, socio-economic development, emergency response and hazards, and land and resource management. Examples of methodological approaches include decision support systems, geocomputation, spatial statistical analysis, complex systems and artificial intelligence, visual analytics and geovisualization, ubiquitous computing, and space-time simulation.
