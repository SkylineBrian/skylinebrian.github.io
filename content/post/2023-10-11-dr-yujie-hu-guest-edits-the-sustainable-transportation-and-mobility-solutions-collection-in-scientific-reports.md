<p>Dr. Yujie Hu serves as a guest editor for the "Sustainable transportation and mobility solutions" collection in the journal <em>Scientific Reports</em>. </p>
<p>Research into sustainable transportation and mobility solutions can help to reduce the negative environmental and social impacts associated with current transportation systems. Key factors are the promotion of energy efficiency, emission reduction, and improved accessibility. Intelligent transportation systems and smart city technologies are utilized to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Increased reliance on public transportation rather than private methods, policies aiming to encourage active modes of transport (such as walking or cycling) and use of low-emission vehicles in place of older high-emission machines help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the quality of life for communities.</p>
