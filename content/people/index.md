## Principal Investigator

**[Dr. Yujie Hu](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/yujiehu/)** — *Associate Professor, Department of Geography*, [University of Florida](https://geog.ufl.edu/)

**Email:** yujiehu (at) ufl.edu  
**Office:** Turlington Hall 3133  
**Phone:** 352-294-7514  
**Affiliate Faculty:** [UF Informatics Institute](https://informatics.institute.ufl.edu/), [UF Transportation Institute](https://www.transportation.institute.ufl.edu/), [Anita Zucker Center for Excellence in Early Childhood Studies](https://ceecs.education.ufl.edu/)

Dr. Hu’s research and teaching focus on **urban transportation**, **human mobility**, and **accessibility**. His current work centers on:  
1) relationships between people’s mobility within cities—including commuting, healthcare-seeking, and crime—and the urban built environment;  
2) spatial accessibility to opportunities such as jobs, healthcare, food, and transportation infrastructure, and how it is affected by natural hazards; and  
3) network flow analysis and optimization of travel patterns related to commuting, bike sharing, healthcare, and food delivery.
