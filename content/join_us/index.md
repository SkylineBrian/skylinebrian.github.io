We are always looking for enthusiastic and self-motivated critical thinkers–undergraduate students, graduate students, or visiting scholars–to join the [GeoNAVI lab](https://geonavilab.geog.ufl.edu/). People in the lab are passionate about urban research and have experience in some combination of spatial analysis, network theory and analysis, statistics, and geovisualization. Relevant disciplines include, but are not limited to, Geography, GIScience, transportation engineering, network science, urban planning, public health, criminology, and environmental science and policy. Any questions can be directed to [Dr. Yujie Hu](https://geonavilab.geog.ufl.edu/people/) at [yujiehu@ufl.edu](mailto:yujiehu@ufl.edu).
