While existing studies have explored mobility disruptions caused by hurricanes, very few have delved into the impact, considering both mobility vulnerability and recovery, on a state level. Utilising mobile phone location data, this research examines the mobility patterns of Florida residents throughout Hurricane Ian. The findings reveal that the hurricane profoundly disturbed the mobility patterns of Floridians. The state experienced a maximum average daily mobility reduction of 63.41%, with certain neighbourhoods coming to a complete standstill at 100% cessation in mobility. On average, Florida neighbourhoods needed 2.61 days for mobility recovery, though this period stretched to as long as 92 days in the most severely affected areas.

Existing research on human mobility has delineated two primary types of individuals: returners, who exhibit a tendency to frequent a limited number of locations, and explorers, characterized by a more diverse range of movement across various places. Yet, whether this mobility dichotomy endures in the context of natural hazards remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by examining anonymized high-resolution mobile phone location data from Lee County, Florida residents, aiming to unravel the dynamics of these distinct mobility groups throughout different phases of Hurricane Ian. The results indicate that returners and explorers maintained their distinct mobility characteristics even during the hurricane, showing increased separability.

The case study on robbery incidents in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shows a temporal cycle with a 6-month period of statistical significance from January 2010 to May 2018.

Since people leave home and start their jobs at different times of the day and since traffic congestion varies throughout the day, neglecting hourly dynamics can misestimate commuting efficiency in a region and lead to erroneous policy implications. Another important issue often overlooked in the past is the modal disparity in commuting efficiency and how it evolves during the day. To overcome these limitations, this research examines the commuting efficiency variation by car and public transport by six one-hour periods between 5 AM and 11 AM in Warsaw, Poland, using travel …","date":1595980800,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"html":"New article first published online: Computers, Environment and Urban Systems; DOI: 10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2020.101523 ABSTRACT: Urban land use is known to affe...","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595980800,"objectID":"03f04bc2bc43a3e079bf7cc1c61381a1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2020/07/29/temporal-dynamics-of-the-impact-of-land-use-on-modal-disparity-in-commuting-efficiency/","publishdate":"2020-07-29T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2020/07/29/temporal-dynamics-of-the-impact-of-land-use-on-modal-disparity-in-commuting-efficiency/","section":"post","tags":["GeoNAVI"],"title":"Temporal dynamics of the impact of land use on modal disparity in commuting efficiency","type":"post","url":"/2020/07/29/temporal-dynamics-of-the-impact-of-land-use-on-modal-disparity-in-commuting-efficiency/","weight":0,"wordcount":281},{"author":null,"categories":["Pubs"],"content":"\rNew article first published online: Environment and Planning B: Urban Analytics and City Science; DOI: 10.1177/2399808320938803\nABSTRACT: The jobs–housing balance and urban spatial structure are naturally connected, and understanding the connection is important for urban planning, geography, and transport studies.

However, gravity-based measures often suffer from three main limitations: (1) they are sensitive to the spatial configuration and scale of the units of analysis, which are not specifically designed for capturing job accessibility patterns and are often too coarse; (2) they omit the temporal dynamics of job opportunities and workers in the calculation, instead assuming that they remain stable over time; and (3) they do not lend themselves to dynamic geovisualization techniques. In this paper, a new methodological framework for measuring and visualizing place-based job accessibility in space and time is presented that overcomes these three limitations.

In addition to prolonged time and stress for individual commuters on traffic, commuting comes with additional societal costs including elevated crash risks, worsening air quality, and louder traffic noise, etc. These issues are important to city planners, policy researchers, and decision makers.\nGIS-Based Simulation and Analysis of Intra-Urban Commuting, presents GIS-based simulation, optimization and statistical approaches to measure, map, analyze, and explain commuting patterns including commuting length and efficiency.

Existing methods such as the popular kernel density estimation (KDE) do not consider the temporal dimension of crime. Building upon recent works in related fields, this article proposes a spatio-temporal framework for predictive hotspot mapping and evaluation. Comparing to existing work in this scope, the proposed framework has four major features: (1) a spatio-temporal kernel density estimation (STKDE) method is applied to include the temporal component in predictive hotspot mapping, (2) a data-driven optimization technique, the likelihood cross-validation, is used to select the most appropriate bandwidths, (3) a statistical significance test is designed to filter out false positives in the density estimates, and (4) a new metric, the predictive accuracy index (PAI) curve, is proposed to evaluate predictive hotspots …","date":1534982400,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":200,"html":"New article first published online: Applied Geography; DOI: 10.1016/j.apgeog.2018.08.001 ABSTRACT: Predictive hotspot mapping plays a critical role in hotspot p...","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534982400,"objectID":"0ac2e32cbf2a58785ad3cde4a6b5e3d4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/08/23/a-spatio-temporal-kernel-density-estimation-framework-for-predictive-crime-hotspot-mapping-and-evaluation/","publishdate":"2018-08-23T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/2018/08/23/a-spatio-temporal-kernel-density-estimation-framework-for-predictive-crime-hotspot-mapping-and-evaluation/","section":"post","tags":["GeoNAVI"],"title":"A spatio-temporal kernel density estimation framework for predictive crime hotspot mapping and evaluation","type":"post","url":"/2018/08/23/a-spatio-temporal-kernel-density-estimation-framework-for-predictive-crime-hotspot-mapping-and-evaluation/","weight":0,"wordcount":179},{"author":null,"categories":["Pubs"],"content":"\rNew article first published online: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; DOI: 10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.030\nABSTRACT: Understanding the spatio-temporal road network accessibility during a hurricane evacuation—the level of ease of residents in an area in reaching evacuation destination sites through the road network—is a critical component of emergency management. While many studies have attempted to measure road accessibility (either in the scope of evacuation or beyond), few have considered both dynamic evacuation demand and characteristics of a hurricane. This study proposes a methodological framework to achieve this goal. In an interval of every six hours, the method first estimates the evacuation demand in terms of number of vehicles per household in each county subdivision (sub-county) by considering the hurricane’s wind radius and track. The closest facility analysis is then employed to model evacuees’ route choices towards the predefined evacuation destinations. …","date":1533513600,"dir":"post\\","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":300,"html":"New article first published online: Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies; DOI: 10.1016/j.trc.2018.07.030 ABSTRACT: Understanding the spatio-tem...","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1533513600,"objectID":"79878eede1992d07de1aed08e9c42b17","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/2018/08/06/where-are-the-dangerous-intersections-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists-a-colocation-based-approach/","publishdate":"2018-08-06T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/2018/08/06/where-are-the-dangerous-intersections-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists-a-colocation-based-approach/","section":"post","tags":["GeoNAVI"],"title":"Where are the dangerous intersections for pedestrians and cyclists: A colocation-based approach","type":"post","url":"/2018/08/06/where-are-the-dangerous-intersections-for-pedestrians-and-cyclists-a-colocation-based-approach/","weight":0,"wordcount":277},{"author":null,"categories":["Pubs"],"content":"\rNew article first published online: Health Services Research; DOI: 10.1111/1475-6773.12616\nABSTRACT:\nObjective\nTo develop an automated, data‐driven, and scale‐flexible method to delineate hospital service areas (HSA s) and hospital referral regions (HRR s) that are up‐to‐date, representative of all patients, and have the optimal localization of hospital visits.\nData Sources\nThe 2011 state inpatient database in Florida from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project.\nStudy Design\nA network optimization method was used to redefine HSA s and HRR s by maximizing patient‐to‐hospital flows within each HSA /HRR while minimizing flows between them.
